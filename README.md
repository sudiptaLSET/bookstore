📚 Book App – React Native Practice Project

This is a **React Native practice project** built around the **Google Books API**. It showcases features such as API integration, state management, pagination, search, and responsive UI design. The project demonstrates a well-structured use of **React Native components** and **modern development tools** like Redux Toolkit, Context API, and Axios.

✨ Features

🔍 Book Search & Filter: Users can search and filter books from the Google Books API in real time.
📚 Book Details: Clicking a book from the list navigates to a detail page showing complete book information.
➕ Add New Book: Users can add a new book, which is reflected on the home screen using context.
📄 Web View: Integrated web view to read book previews directly from the Google Books link.
📱 Responsive Design: UI is responsive across mobile and tablet screens.
🧭 Navigation: 
Stack Navigation for screen flow
Top Tab Navigation for categorizing views
 🔁 Pagination: Implemented smooth, scroll-based pagination with the FlatList.
 ⚛️ State Management:

Redux Toolkit: Used to store and access book data (e.g. selected book for detail view)
Context API: Used to manage and inject newly added book data into the FlatList

🧰 Tech Stack

React Native(Expo)
Axios – for API calls
Redux Toolkit – for global state management
Context API – for local state updates (e.g., adding new book)
React Navigation – Stack and Tab navigators
FlatList – optimized rendering of long book lists
WebView – for embedded book previews

📌 Learning Goals

This project was built as a hands-on learning exercise to strengthen my understanding of:

* Working with REST APIs (Google Books API)
* Combining Redux and Context in a single app
* Implementing pagination, filtering, and search in lists
* Designing responsive UIs for mobile and tablet
* Structuring modular and reusable components
